## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 21.x (see `.nvmrc`)
- Yarn package manager

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server
yarn serve

# Build for production
yarn build

# Preview production build
yarn preview

# Lint code
yarn lint
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file for local development:

```
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=8130
HTTPS=false
```

Available environment variables:
- `HOST` - Development server host (default: localhost)
- `PORT` - Development server port (default: 8080)
- `HTTPS` - Enable HTTPS for development server
- `VUE_APP_DORME` - Debug mode flag
- `VUE_APP_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` - Google Analytics tracking ID

```

### Key Technologies

- **Vue 3** with Composition API and Options API (compat mode)
- **Vite 5** for fast development and optimized builds
- **TypeScript** for type-safe code
- **Three.js** for 3D graphics
- **TensorFlow.js** for machine learning
- **Plotly.js** for data visualization
- **@k-l-lambda/lotus** for music notation rendering
- **@k-l-lambda/music-widgets** for music playback

### Build Commands

```bash
# Generate Rubik's Cube data tables
yarn cube3-gentable6
yarn cube3-gensolvermap
yarn cube3-genhash
```

### Coding Style

- Use tabs for indentation
- Use double quotes for strings
- Use semicolons
- Stroustrup brace style
- Prefer `const` over `let`

## Machine Learning Models

Some features require pre-trained models to be downloaded:

**StyleGAN Mapping Model:**
Download from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nJYeJ4GLBXrXS_iXdd30DsBztpZx1UDM/view?usp=sharing) and extract to `static/mlmodels/`

## Production Deployment

```bash
# Build the application
yarn build

# The built files will be in the docs/ directory
# Serve with any static file server or use the included Express server
yarn start
```

The Express server supports:
- Custom host and port via environment variables
- HTTPS with certificates in `certificates/` directory
- Serving the built application from `docs/`

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- WebGL required for 3D visualizations
- Web Audio API required for sound features
